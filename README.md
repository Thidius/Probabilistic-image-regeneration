# Image-regeneration-using-Metropolis-Hastings-algorithm
The code regenerates a black and white image of any image input using Metropolis Hastings algorithm. 

The user inputs any image, and the Python code turns into a normalized probability distribution in R^2. The Metropolis Hastings algorithm then samples from this distribution.
Eventually, after many iterations, the converged probability distribution is plotted, and the image is recreated from randomness.
